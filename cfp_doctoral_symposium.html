            <h2 class="ml-3 mt-3">Goal and Scope</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <p>The overall goal of the ICSME 2019 doctoral symposium is to help the next generation of ICSME researchers form connections and gain advice on their proposed areas of research. To support this goal the doctoral symposium will have three tracks: early predoctoral (pre-proposal), late predoctoral (post-proposal), and post-doctoral. Each track will work towards the goal as appropriate for its career preparation stage. The three tracks will meet together for the day to enable multi-level peer mentoring as more senior students and junior researchers reflect on their experiences during their PhD studies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <h2 class="ml-3 mt-3">Early Predoctoral (Pre-proposal) Track</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <p>This track is open to all students who are or are considering pursuing a doctoral degree in the general area of software maintenance and evolution but have not yet completed the dissertation proposal phase (or equivalent) of their program. Students should have already participated in at least one independent study/research project as part of their research group. This track aims to expose early career students to the ICSME research community and research process and to help them progress toward their dissertation proposal.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <h2 class="ml-3 mt-3">Late Predoctoral (Post-proposal) Track</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <p>This track is open to PhD students currently pursuing a doctoral degree in the general area of software maintenance and evolution, who have completed the dissertation proposal phase (or equivalent) of their program. This track aims to bring together students who (a) are pursuing a specific research question, (b) have a concrete research plan for completing their studies, and (c) have obtained some initial results motivating their methodology and plan. Students will gain feedback from a broader community outside their institution and network with peers in the ICSME research community.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <h2 class="ml-3 mt-3">Post-doctoral Track</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <p>This track is open to researchers who have recently completed their PhD dissertation in the general area of software maintenance and evolution. This track provides an opportunity for participants to present their research agenda to a general audience and gain feedback in preparation for job interviews. Participants will develop a research vision that builds on their dissertation and learn to present it to a general audience who is familiar with the research area, but not their specific project or focus.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <h2 class="ml-3 mt-3">Evaluation</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <p>All submissions that meet the submission criteria (see below) and fit the scope of the conference will be evaluated by the doctoral symposium chairs on the basis of their relevance to the ICSME community, their originality, and their technical soundness. Submissions that are not in compliance with the required submission format or that are out of the scope of the conference will be rejected without being reviewed. Submitted papers must comply with IEEE plagiarism policy and procedures.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <h2 class="ml-3 mt-3">Publication and Presentation</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <p>Accepted post-proposal and post-doctoral papers will be published in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Please review the <a href="publication_reqs.html" target="_blank">ICSME 2019 Publication Requirements</a> for more details. Participants from all tracks will present at the symposium, which is closed to the public ICSME community to encourage valuable open discussion and feedback. Presentations will be limited in time to leave sufficient time for feedback. Each participant will also prepare and present a poster during the symposium (for feedback). During the main conference, the author will present the poster again at a public poster session. More presentation details will follow after notification of acceptance.</p>

            <p>Submissions must be formatted according to the <a href="formatting_guidelines.html" target="_blank">ICSME 2019 Formatting Instructions</a>. Papers should provide all details (name, affiliation, contact details) of the PhD student. Page limits vary by track, as described below.

                <li>The submission should include a description of a research project in which you have already participated. Focus on research questions and on lessons learned so far about the research and the research process. Expound on your own proposal ideas. What is your general research area? What open questions/problems do you find personally meaningful, and why are they interesting to you? It is acceptable for this to be a broad outline of the research area and where you think you might want to contribute.</li>
                <li>The paper should explicitly list the studentâ€™s supervisor(s), including their affiliation.</li>

Think big picture! - and two or three "lessons" you learned through the PhD process. Reflect on what worked well and what could have gone better.</li>
