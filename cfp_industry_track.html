            The industry track brings together participants from academia and industry in a venue that highlights practical and real-world studies of software maintenance and evolution. This track aims to foster mutually-beneficial links between those engaged in scientific research and practitioners working to improve software maintenance and evolution practices. Experiences from practitioners provide crucial input into future research directions and allow others to learn from successes and failures.

            <p>Researcher-driven submissions:<br/>A paper is considered researcher-driven if the main author(s) are researchers (the paper can have industrial co-authors). Researcher-driven submissions to the industry track should be distinguished from research track submissions by richness in industrial data or their focus on industrial cases.</p>
            <p>Practitioner-driven submissions:<br/>A paper is considered practitioner-driven if the main author(s) are practitioners (the paper can have co-authors from academia). These papers may focus more on specific cases or applications and do not require the same degree of generalizability as researcher-driven submissions.</p>

            Submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the industry track program committee. The committee consists to 50-70% of practitioners or industrial researchers, who have a good understanding of the value of industry contributions. The evaluation serves the purpose to ensure the quality of the submissions and provide constructive feedback. Papers that successfully pass the review process will be accepted for presentation and publication. The type of the paper (researcher-driven or practitioner-driven) will be considered during the review.
