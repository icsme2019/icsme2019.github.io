            <p>ICSME 2019 is co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society. The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to IEEE’s aims and goals. These require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group; fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect; and embraces diversity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <p>For these reasons, ICSE 2019 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at our events and in official communications channels, including social media. We want every participant to feel welcome, included, respected, and safe. There is no tolerance for unwelcome or hostile behavior or speech that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation at our conference and events.</p>
