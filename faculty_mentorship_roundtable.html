        <p>The Faculty Mentorship Roundtable program aims to connect junior SE faculty with more senior mentors, and with peers at similar stage of their career. It is intended to provide a low-pressure atmosphere to foster building one’s support group and mentorship.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row ml-3 mr-1 pb-3">
        <p>Participants will have the opportunity to suggest the topics they struggle with, ranging from research directions to career tips to “soft skills” (e.g., managing priorities, a quality process for hiring students, mentoring students to grow into tomorrow’s leaders, etc). Mentors will get to pass along their tips for success in software research and mentoring students.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
        The expected outcomes are:
      </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1 pt-3">
          <ul>
            <li>Increase the feelings of community and belonging among junior faculty through positive interactions with peers and more established faculty</li>
            <li>Exchange peer-best-practices in developing students, along with lessons learned from trial-and-error</li>
            <li>Establish new connections and collaborations between junior and more established faculty</li>
            <li>Grow the roundtable discussion group into a support group that will be a growth and accountability resource long after ICSME’19</li>
            <li>Create a culture of support, growth, and welcoming in the software maintenance and evolution research community</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
      <div class="row ml-3 mr-1 pb-3">
        <p>This session follows the success of the Faculty Mentorship Roundtables from FSE’18 and ICSE'19. The main motivation is the desire of junior faculty to discuss career advice with members of the community that have had more time to experiment and learn, and openly discuss solutions on how to hire, train and develop the next generation of students to become tomorrow’s technical leaders. We will discuss proven methods to raise student leaders, for example the philosophy and legacy of David Notkin “Focus on the students, since graduating great students means you’ll produce great research, while focusing on the research may or may not produce great students.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row ml-3 mr-1 pb-3">
        <p>By identifying faculty who are willing and excited to share what they are learning, we aim to reduce the pressure on the young faculty and facilitate connections in a relaxed atmosphere.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row ml-3 mr-1 pb-3">
        <p>The Faculty Mentorship Roundtable program will be held on two of the days of the main ICSME conference (Wed and/or Thu). We will have roundtable discussions during the lunch period to make it maximally easy for all participants to schedule. We will strive to provide one roundtable for women only to make it easier for women faculty to address issues that are difficult in a gender-mixed roundtable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row ml-3 mr-1 pb-3">
        <p>Younger participants in the mentoring session will express which research areas they work in (and optionally which senior researchers they would like to meet) and what are the main struggles where they need advice. Based on these preferences, the organizers of the mentoring session will form the roundtable groups.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <h2 class="ml-3 mt-3">Application</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row ml-3 mr-1"> 
        <p>Faculty will apply to the mentorship sessions using a brief application process. We ask for the following information:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row ml-3 mr-1"> 
        <p>Stage in career (pre- or post-tenure faculty, etc.), What research area they work in, Whether they had a faculty support group in the past and how this engaged them, What are the main challenges they see they are not fully resourced to handle, and (Optional) Who they would like to meet with as a mentor.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <h2 class="ml-3 mt-3">Selection Process</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row ml-3 mr-1"> 
        <p>We have only 20 slots available for faculty in this program.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row ml-3 mr-1"> 
        <p>Mentors in the program are selected initially by the organizing committee, based on recommendations from other faculty that attended similar events. We will expand based on requests from participants. Junior faculty will be selected by the organizers based on a combination of factors, including experience, stage of career, and their needs and challenges, as indicated above. We aim to select a diverse group, based on a need for mentorship.</p>
