          <p>Student volunteers play a crucial role in ensuring the success of ICSME. They help with everything from registration to local support. Being a student volunteer is an excellent opportunity to meet, interact, and network with leading academic and industrial researchers and practitioners in the area of Software Engineering. Such interactions often help shape the research direction for many a student. Being a student volunteer is also a great way to meet other students from all over the world that share your interest in Software Engineering as well as reduce some of the costs of the conference!</p>
