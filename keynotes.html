            <p><strong>Short Bio:</strong> 

              Jochen Quante is a senior expert for software analysis and design at Bosch Corporate Research. He studied computer science at University of Karlsruhe (Germany) and then started his career as a software developer for a medium-sized company.  After six years of collecting practical experience, he went back to university to research in software reengineering as an assistant of Prof. Dr. Rainer Koschke.  His seminal paper on "Dynamic Object Process Graphs" received the best paper award at CSMR 2006, and Jochen was conferred a doctorate degree from University of Bremen in 2009 for this work.  Jochen joined Bosch Corporate Research and has worked on many reengineering projects and software analysis tasks on automotive software since.  He gained a lot of experience in practical program understanding needs, and his research focused on static analyses for satisfying these needs.  Within Bosch, he is meanwhile a "senior expert for software analysis and design", which means internal consultant, researcher, and trainer for these topics.  Jochen has also continuously published on software analysis and reengineering topics since and served in many program committees (e.g. ICSME, SCAM, ICPC).</p>
