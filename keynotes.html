            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
              The culmination of the Usenix Security 2019 keynote by ex-Yahoo CSO, ex-Facebook CSO, current Stanford adjunct Alex Stamos was an imposing challenge “The nerds inherited the earth. We gotta do better.” Indeed, every living being on this planet both benefits and feels the impact of us nerds (a term I’ve never been fond of, as a female, but that’s another keynote). Much ado lately has been on improving academic-industry collaboration in software engineering research to increase our impact, but what about the “living beings”? I will share an introspection of what I’ve learned during my 20 year academic career intentionally involving as much industrial collaboration as possible with the purpose of increasing the impact of our work. I will also share my thoughts on bringing “society” and its needs as a first class customer for the contributions of software engineering research. Society has no choice but to count on us.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
              Software was first introduced in cars 40 years ago. Since then, it has undergone a tremendous evolution. It has long since become the main driver for innovation. With current developments towards automated and connected driving, software becomes even more important - but also even more complex. In this talk, I will look back at the evolution of automotive software at Bosch and highlight the major influencing factors, challenges, and solutions. For example, the introduction of model-based development solved some problems, but also has its drawbacks with respect to maintainability. This retrospective provides insights into striking software evolution effects in the automotive domain. Several of the encountered challenges still remain unsolved today and thus offer research opportunities. I will furthermore discuss upcoming new technologies and their impact on future automotive software maintenance and evolution.</p>

              Jochen Quante is a senior expert for software analysis and design at Bosch Corporate Research. He studied computer science at University of Karlsruhe (Germany) and then started his career as a software developer for a medium-sized company.  After six years of collecting practical experience, he went back to university to research in software reengineering as an assistant of Prof. Dr. Rainer Koschke.  His seminal paper on "Dynamic Object Process Graphs" received the best paper award at CSMR 2006, and Jochen was conferred a doctorate degree from University of Bremen in 2009 for this work.  Jochen joined Bosch Corporate Research and has worked on many reengineering projects and software analysis tasks on automotive software since.  He gained a lot of experience in practical program understanding needs, and his research focused on static analyses for satisfying these needs.  Within Bosch, he is meanwhile a "senior expert for software analysis and design", which means internal consultant, researcher, and trainer for these topics.  Jochen has also continuously published on software analysis and reengineering topics since and served in many program committees (e.g. ICSME, SCAM, ICPC).</p>
