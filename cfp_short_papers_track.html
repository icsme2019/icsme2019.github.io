            <p class="mt-3">The Short Papers Track provides an opportunity for sharing valuable early-stage work with the ICMSE community, eliciting feedback, and fostering discussions and collaborations among researchers interested in the broad area of Software Maintenance and Evolution.</p>
            <p>The scope of research topics of this track is the same as for the main conference. We encourage researchers and practitioners to submit work-in-progress to discuss ongoing research, negative results, practical experience, challenges or issues related to software maintenance and evolution. The papers in this track do not require a strong empirical evaluation.</p>

                <p>All submissions that meet the submission criteria (see below) and fit the scope of the conference will be reviewed by members of the ERA track program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of soundness, quality and consistency of presentation, position with respect to related work, and evaluation (if available - a complete evaluation is not required). </p>

        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <p>We use the double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. This means that authors should:</p>

       <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <ul>
                <li>Leave out author names and affiliations from the body and the metadata of the submitted pdf.</li>
                <li>Ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in the third person, for example “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work [2]”.</li>
                <li>Not refer to their personal, lab or university website; similarly, care should be taken with personal accounts on GitHub, Bitbucket, Google Drive, etc.</li>
                <li>Not upload unblinded versions of their paper on archival websites during bidding/reviewing, however uploading unblinded versions prior to submission is allowed and sometimes unavoidable (e.g., thesis).</li>
