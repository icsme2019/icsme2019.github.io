        <h2 class="ml-3 mt-3">Why Stay at a Conference Hotel?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
        <p>You'll be in the center of conference activity, that's why! You'll be able to network easily with other conference attendees. You'll have a better conference experience overall. But there are other reasons that you need to consider before you look at a hotel outside the official ICSME 2019 room block.</p>
        <p>The conference staff have taken their role of finding a conference site very seriously. They have looked at a number of locations and evaluated the needs of attendees as well as the need for conference meeting space. Based on a guaranteed percentage of attendees staying in official conference hotels, the hotels provide discounted group rates from their normal charges.</p>
        <p>If the conference does not meet the contracted sleeping room commitment, the hotel in some cases can charge the conference for the missing revenue. Unfilled rooms can cost the conference thousands of dollars which can apply pressure to increase the conference registration fees to offset these costs. So, please support the conference by staying at the official conference hotel. We think you will find the increased networking opportunities, quality hotel services and amenities, and proximity to the conference activities to be worth it!</p>

      <div class="row">
        <h2 class="ml-3 mt-3">How do I check-in to the conference hotel?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
        <p>When you arrive at the hotel venue, you will need to visit the front desk upstairs to check-in. The front desk is located near the front of the hotel adjacent the hotel bar and lounge. The rear entrance of the hotel (facing Euclid Ave.) is nearest to the RTA dropoff point.</p>
        <p>If you are ariving to the hotel late in the evening, be sure to enter through the front entrance (facing Superior Ave.) as the rear entrance is only accessable with a hotel keycard between the hours of 19:00 and 6:00.</p>
