            <p class="mt-3">Following the success of previous editions of the Journal First / Conference Second (J1C2) track, this year's ICSME will also invite presentations of journal papers based on submissions from authors. We aim to accommodate as many journal-first presentations will fit into the ICSME program.  The J1C2 track is aimed at papers that (a) are theme-appropriate for ICSME, (b) have recently accepted to one of the participating journals, and (c) concern work that has not previously been presented at a conference (i.e., the journal paper must not be an extension of a previous conference/workshop paper).</p>
            <p>The participating journals are:  <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/10664" target="_blank">Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)</a>, <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-and-software-technology" target="_blank">Information and Software Technology (IST)</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20477481" target="_blank">Journal of Software: Evolution and Process (JSEP)</a>, and <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-systems-and-software" target="_blank">Journal of Systems and Software (JSS)</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            The J1C2 track is aimed at recent journal papers describing original and unpublished results that relate to software maintenance and evolution, and are not extensions of previous conference papers. A journal-first paper must adhere to all of the following criteria:
        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1 mt-3">
            <ul>
                <li>It must report completely new research results, or presents novel contributions that significantly extend and were not previously reported in prior work.</li>
                <li>It may not extend any of the author's prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms (or other such details presented for completeness), additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work.</li>
                <li>It may not repurpose materials previously published at a conference that targets software professionals.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1 mt-3">
            We invite the authors of papers that satisfy the Journal-First criteria to submit a talk proposal. For a journal paper to be eligible to participate in the J1C2 program at ICSME 2019, the paper must:

        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1 mt-3">
            <ul>
                <li>Be in scope of the conference, that is, the paper contains work related to software maintenance and evolution (see the <a href="cfp_research_track.html" target="_blank">ICSME Research Track Call for Papers</a> for possible topics).</li>
                <li>Have been accepted in one of the participating journals: <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/10664" target="_blank">Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)</a>, <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-and-software-technology" target="_blank">Information and Software Technology (IST)</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20477481" target="_blank">Journal of Software: Evolution and Process (JSEP)</a>, and <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-systems-and-software" target="_blank">Journal of Systems and Software (JSS)</a>.</li>
                <li>Have been accepted on or after January 1, 2018 and before the J1C2 submission deadline.</li>
                <li>Not have already been presented, or currently being considered for, J1C2 or similar initiatives of other conferences. </li>

        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <p>Interested authors should submit a short talk proposal consisting of the paper title, abstract, a short statement on how the work satisfies the journal first criteria, and the PDF of the accepted paper. Please list all authors of the original journal paper as authors in EasyChair.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <p>The J1C2 committee will evaluate if the submission is within the scope of the ICSME conference and, in general, fulfills the eligibility criteria mentioned above. We plan to select as many papers as possible for inclusion in the J1C2 program. In case that the interest in the J1C2 is higher than expected, the track chairs, together with the conference technical program co-chairs, will reserve the right to prioritize papers that better fit in the conference technical program.</p>
            <p>As the papers have been already reviewed and accepted by high quality journals, they will not be reviewed again for technical correctness. They will be checked for the Journal-First criteria and prioritized according to fit to the conference theme. Authors will not receive any reviews with the notification.</p>

            <h2 class="ml-3 mt-3">Presentation</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <p>At least one author of each accepted J1C2 contribution must register and attend the conference to present the paper. Failure to present the paper might result in exclusion from future J1C2 programs.</p>
            <p>The J1C2 papers will not be part of the ICSME proceedings. However, the conference online program will contain a hyperlink to the journal paper (if already published) or, in case the paper hasnâ€™t been published yet, to its preprint (we will encourage the authors of accepted J1C2 make a preprint of the paper available to ICSME).</p>
