        <h2 class="ml-3 mt-3">Why Stay at a Conference Hotel?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row ml-3 mr-1 pb-3">
        <p>You'll be in the center of conference activity, that's why! You'll be able to network easily with other conference attendees. You'll have a better conference experience overall. But there are other reasons that you need to consider before you look at a hotel outside the official ICSME 2019 room block.</p>
        <p>The conference staff have taken their role of finding a conference site very seriously. They have looked at a number of locations and evaluated the needs of attendees as well as the need for conference meeting space. Based on a guaranteed percentage of attendees staying in official conference hotels, the hotels provide discounted group rates from their normal charges.</p>
        <p>If the conference does not meet the contracted sleeping room commitment, the hotel in some cases can charge the conference for the missing revenue. Unfilled rooms can cost the conference thousands of dollars which can apply pressure to increase the conference registration fees to offset these costs. So, please support the conference by staying at the official conference hotel. We think you will find the increased networking opportunities, quality hotel services and amenities, and proximity to the conference activities to be worth it!</p>
