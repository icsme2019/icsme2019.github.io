            The Late-Breaking Ideas Track is a new addition to the ICSME program for 2019. The overarching goal of this track is to provide a highly interactive and collaborative venue for ICSME researchers of all backgrounds to conduct impactful, meaningful discussions about cutting edge or emerging work conducted related to software engineering, maintenance, and evolution. As such, this track accepts 2-page extended abstracts.  Accepted abstracts will be briefly presented and thoroughly discussed in a highly interactive conference format. Thus, we anticipate this track facilitating discussion on novel, high impact ideas relevant to the ICSME community and directly fostering collaborations to advance fledgling research ideas.

            <h4 class="ml-3 mt-3">What is expected in a Late Breaking Idea Submission</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <p>A Late-Breaking Idea submission should be a crisp two page extended abstract highlighting the problem being addressed and describing the novel method in which it is or will be solved. Preliminary results are not necessarily expected however, a sound method of solving the problem is expected. The abstract should provide simulating ideas relevant to the ICSME community. These ideas (could be controversial or challenge the status-quo)  should be amenable to discussion and collaboration from the larger ICSME community. Work that has not been fully tested or validated is welcome in this track because we realize that collecting empirical data takes time. This track provides authors a way to get their work out while they are working on completing their data collection and seeing their idea being fully realized.  The abstract should clearly indicate the cutting-edge work yet to be fully realized. We expect that these abstracts will become full submissions to ICSME in the future. Please note that merely summarising an existing paper or a shortened version of an ICSME main paper does not qualify for this track. </p>
            <p>It is expected that the late breaking track will foster a highly interactive session between authors and conference attendees. The Late-Breaking Work track invites participation from a broad range of disciplines covering software maintenance. We encourage submissions from the broader ICSME community as well as those new to the ICSME community. This venue is also an excellent way for those new to the ICSME community to share their work and become acquainted with the field. </p>
            <p>Late-Breaking abstracts will appear in the ICSME proceedings. Copyright is retained by the authors.  Authors are expected to use this work as the basis for future publications as long as there are “significant” revisions from the original submission.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            The goal of the Late-Breaking Ideas Track is to complement the Short paper track by providing researchers an opportunity to get an idea out early to be discussed among the community.  Examples of work submitted could include design methods, experimental designs, new theories, preliminary results, novel or emerging idea. Submissions to the Late-Breaking ideas track will enjoy thorough discussion and feedback from the broader research community through sessions that include a higher level of interactivity than the Short paper track.
