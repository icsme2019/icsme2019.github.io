            <p class="mt-3">Traditionally, technical research papers are published without including any artifacts (e.g., tools, data repositories, frameworks, videos), even though these artifacts may serve as crucial and detailed evidence for the quality of the results that the associated paper offers. Following the effort initiated at ESEC/FSEâ€™11, authors of accepted technical papers at ICSME 2019 can have their artifacts evaluated by the program committee. Positively evaluated artifacts will be reflected in the paper publication, presentation, and be formally announced during the conference.</p>
            <p>The goal of the Artifact Track of ICSME 2019 is to promote, celebrate, and catalog excellent examples of research artifacts in software engineering. These artifacts are reusable units of research that can be used to support other research endeavors.</p>
            <p>Artifacts of interest include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Software.</strong> Implementations of systems or algorithms potentially useful in other studies.</li>
                <li><strong>Data repositories.</strong> Data that can be used for multiple software engineering approaches (e.g., logging data, system traces, survey raw data).</li>
                <li><strong>Frameworks.</strong> Tools and services illustrating new approaches to software engineering that could be used by other researchers in different contexts.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <p>This list is not exhaustive, but if your proposed artifact is not on this list, please email the chairs <strong>before submitting</strong>. For artifacts that are executable tools, you may also consider submitting to the Tool Demonstration Track of ICSME 2019.</p>
            <p>ICSME 2019 allows two types of artifact submissions:</p>
            <p><strong>Evaluation artifacts:</strong> For artifacts related to a Research Track paper accepted at ICSME 2019. Authors of accepted artifacts of this type will enjoy the following benefits:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recognition</strong> on the conference website.</li>
                <li>A <strong>one-page paper</strong> in the proceedings describing the artifact.</li>
                <li>The opportunity to <strong>present the artifact</strong> in a dedicated Artifacts Session at the conference (in addition to the presentation for the associated Research Track paper).</li>
            </ul> 
        </div>

        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <p><strong>Independent artifacts:</strong> For artifacts related to a paper published previously or unrelated to any paper published so far. Authors of accepted artifacts of this type will enjoy the following benefits:</p>

        <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <ul>

                <p>All submissions that meet the submission criteria listed below, fit the scope of the conference, and comply with the IEEE plagiarism policy and procedures will be reviewed by three members of the Artifacts Track Program Committee.

            <p>To hide the identity of the reviewers from the authors, the artifact track chairs will download the artifact and distribute it to the reviewers. The authors should also make an effort not to learn the identity of the reviewers, e.g., through logging.</p>

            <p>High-quality packaging of an artifact is as important as the quality of the artifact itself. Please keep in mind that the committee members will have limited time to review each artifact. The following requirements for the artifact are meant to expedite the review process:</p>
        </div>
       <div class="row ml-3 mr-1">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Create a single .zip archive</strong>, containing:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>README.txt</strong> with instructions (how to use the artifact, how to reproduce the results presented in the ICSME 2019 research paper, if the artifact is associated to one;</li>
                    <li><strong>The ICSME 2019 research paper</strong> (if applicable),</li>
                    <li><strong>The artifact itself</strong>.</li>
                    <li>You may also submit a video with a demo and/or instructions.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>In case you want to submit a running setup of your artifact, please provide an installation script to simplify the reviewing process. If the artifact requires a non-standard environment (e.g., specific OS, many external dependencies) we encourage you to create a virtual machine using Virtual box (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" target="_blank">www.virtualbox.org</a>). Please use only such system images that are compatible with Virtual box.</li>
                <li>If obtaining all the results takes a significant amount of time, please also include a script to reproduce only a subset of the results.</li>
